6. Ensure tests pass and code follows the existing style

## 🛠 Development Commands

| Command            | Description                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |

## 🌿 Branch Naming

Use the following prefixes when naming branches:

- `fix/` — Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/invoice-due-date-validation`)
- `feature/` — New features (e.g., `feature/moloni-provider`)
- `enhance/` — Enhancements to existing behaviour (e.g., `enhance-actions-structure`)
- `docs/` — Documentation-only changes

## ✅ Commit Guidelines

* Use clear, concise commit messages
* Prefer the imperative mood (e.g. `Fix bug`, not `Fixed bug`)
* Keep commits focused and atomic

Example:

```
Add validation to invoice payload
```

* Make sure all checks and tests pass

Your PR may be reviewed and feedback may be requested. Please be responsive — this helps get your contribution merged faster.
